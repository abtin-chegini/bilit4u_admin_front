# Invoice Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the invoice pages (success and failed) into the third step of the payment flow as component-based solutions instead of separate pages.

## Changes Made

### 1. PaymentStep.tsx
**Location:** `/components/dashboard_admin_buy/pdp/new/PaymentStep.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Modified payment success flow to call `onPaymentSuccess` callback instead of redirecting to `/invoice/success`
- Modified payment failure flow to call `onPaymentSuccess` callback instead of redirecting to `/invoice/failed`
- Both success and failed payments now trigger the callback with appropriate payment data
- Payment data structure includes:
  - `success: boolean` - Determines if payment was successful
  - `message: string` - Success or error message
  - `passengers: array` - Passenger information
  - `ticketData: object` - Ticket details
  - `totalPrice: number` - Total payment amount
  - `pricePerTicket: number` - Price per ticket
  - `refNum: string` - Reference number (for successful payments)

### 2. InvoiceStep.tsx
**Location:** `/components/dashboard_admin_buy/pdp/new/InvoiceStep.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Completely rewrote the component to incorporate full UI from invoice success and failed pages
- Component now conditionally renders based on `paymentData.success`:
  - `success: true` → Shows beautiful success invoice with:
    - Animated success icon
    - Trip route visualization
    - Complete trip details (date, time, company, price)
    - Passenger information cards
    - Payment transaction details
    - Action buttons (print ticket, back to dashboard)
  - `success: false` → Shows detailed failure page with:
    - Animated error icon
    - Error details and message
    - Possible failure reasons
    - Order summary (if available)
    - Action buttons (retry, back to dashboard)

**Features:**
- Full animation support using Framer Motion
- Persian digit conversion for all numbers
- Beautiful gradient cards and styling
- Responsive design
- Complete payment and passenger information display

### 3. BusReservationWithStepper.tsx
**Location:** `/components/dashboard_admin_buy/pdp/new/BusReservationWithStepper.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Updated navigation buttons condition to hide them on step 2 (invoice step)
- Changed from `currentStep < steps.length - 1` to `currentStep < 2`
- This ensures that when users reach the invoice step, they only see the action buttons within the InvoiceStep component (Back to Dashboard, Print Ticket/Retry)

## Flow Summary

### Success Flow:
1. User completes seat selection and passenger details (Step 0)
2. User proceeds to payment step (Step 1)
3. User confirms payment via wallet
4. Payment API returns success
5. PaymentStep calls `onPaymentSuccess` with complete payment data
6. Stepper moves to Step 2 (Invoice Step)
7. InvoiceStep renders success component with all details
8. User can print ticket or go back to dashboard

### Failure Flow:
1. User completes seat selection and passenger details (Step 0)
2. User proceeds to payment step (Step 1)
3. User confirms payment via wallet
4. Payment API returns failure or throws error
5. PaymentStep calls `onPaymentSuccess` with failed payment data (success: false)
6. Stepper moves to Step 2 (Invoice Step)
7. InvoiceStep renders failure component with error details
8. User can retry or go back to dashboard

## Data Structure

### Payment Data (Success):
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  refNum: string,           // Transaction reference number
  message: string,          // Success message from API
  passengers: Array<{
    name: string,
    family: string,
    nationalId: string,
    gender: number,         // 2=male, 1=female
    birthDate: string,
    seatNo: number
  }>,
  ticketData: {
    ServiceNo: string,
    CoName: string,
    DepartDate: string,
    DepartTime: string,
    SrcCityName: string,
    DesCityName: string,
    BusType: string,
    // ... other ticket details
  },
  totalPrice: number,
  pricePerTicket: number
}
```

### Payment Data (Failed):
```typescript
{
  success: false,
  message: string,          // Error message
  passengers: Array<{...}>, // Same structure as success
  ticketData: {...},        // Same structure as success
  totalPrice: number,
  pricePerTicket: number,
  error: Error             // Original error object
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Component-Based:** No need for separate pages, everything is within the stepper flow
2. **Better UX:** Users stay within the same flow without page redirects
3. **Consistent State:** Payment data is passed directly to the invoice component
4. **Animations:** Beautiful animations using Framer Motion for better user experience
5. **Comprehensive Display:** Shows all relevant information (passengers, tickets, payment details)
6. **Responsive:** Works on all screen sizes
7. **Localized:** All numbers displayed in Persian digits
8. **Clear Actions:** Appropriate action buttons for each state (success/failure)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test successful payment flow
- [ ] Test failed payment flow (insufficient balance)
- [ ] Verify all passenger information displays correctly
- [ ] Verify all ticket information displays correctly
- [ ] Test print functionality
- [ ] Test back to dashboard navigation
- [ ] Test retry functionality on failed payments
- [ ] Verify Persian digit conversion
- [ ] Test animations
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile/tablet/desktop

## Notes

- Session storage still maintains payment data for potential future use
- The invoice pages at `/app/invoice/success/page.tsx` and `/app/invoice/failed/page.tsx` are still functional but are no longer used in the main flow
- All styling uses Tailwind CSS with custom Iranian Yekan fonts
- Component follows RTL (right-to-left) design for Persian language support
